<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sublime Text 2  Vs Vim</h1>

<p>Sublime Text 2 is not free, let me start there, I just got lucky with a copy of license from the office. A license costs around US$ 70.</p>
<p> I am starting to learn how to use command line editors and the fact that Sublime Text 2 does mimic almost all shortcuts I have on my macbook makes it easy to quickly get through any document that requires editing</p>
<p> I have previously been using Vim and i have found that I have to remember all the commands to navigate through. I do not get to code day to day so this makes it hard to remember the longer I stay away from the interface.
<p> Down Side </p>
Sublime will pop's out of the terminal(guess thats the way its supposed to be) however this makes it hard to working with terminal multiplexers like Tmux.
<p> After downloading and intalling Sublime Text 2, I ran the following commands to add it to my local path so that i can launch it directly from my terminal.
After 
<pre><code>$ ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/sublime
</code></pre>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
