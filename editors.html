<p>Sublime Text 2 is not free, let me start there, I just got lucky with a copy of license from the office. A license costs around US$ 70.</p>
<p> I am starting to learn how to use command line editors and the fact that Sublime Text 2 does mimic almost all shortcuts I have on my macbook makes it easy to quickly get through any document that requires editing</p>
<p> I have previously been using Vim and i have found that I have to remember all the commands to navigate through. I do not get to code day to day so this makes it hard to remember the longer I stay away from the interface.
<p> Down Side </p>
Sublime will pop's out of the terminal(guess thats the way its supposed to be) however this makes it hard to working with terminal multiplexers like Tmux.
<p> After downloading and intalling Sublime Text 2, I ran the following commands to add it to my local path so that i can launch it directly from my terminal.
After 
<pre><code>$ ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/sublime
</code></pre>
